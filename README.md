## Pytest
The pytest framework makes it easy to write small, readable tests, and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

### Setup env for Pytest
PS> python -m venv venv
PS> .\venv\Scripts\activate
(venv) PS> python -m pip install pytest


### Arrange-Act-Assert model
1. Arrange, or set up, the conditions for the test
2. Act by calling some function or method
3. Assert that some end condition is true
